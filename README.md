Simple 3D puzzle with orthographic camera. Made a video tutorial.
You're playing for a red rectangle that needs to be freed from this trap. But it's not that simple: in addition to you, there are other figures that move only vertically and horizontally. They make it much harder to get through, but don't forget the buttons that are great for activating and deactivating objects.
